# maptic

<!-- Plugin description -->
**maptic** is a tool window plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that generates an interactive, visual representation of a codebase. It analyzes the project's source code structure, creates a tree of classes and methods, and provides AI-generated explanations for them using OpenAI's GPT model.

## Features

- **Code Tree Visualization**: A tree structure that shows the hierarchy of classes and methods in the codebase, making it easier to understand the structure of the project.
- **Bubble Roadmap**: Interactive "bubbles" that represent classes and methods, which expand on hover and display a short explanation generated by OpenAI for each item.
- **Class Diagram**: A BFS (Breadth-First Search) layout that generates a class diagram, visually representing the relationships between classes and their methods.
- **Real-Time Code Insights**: Each class and method can have AI-generated descriptions, which are fetched dynamically from OpenAI's API.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Click on the elements in the tree or diagram to navigate directly to their definitions in the code.
- **Refresh Views**: A "Refresh" button allows you to reload the code structure, AI explanations, and diagrams to ensure they are up to date with the latest changes.
